- Implemented by embedding the detail document within the user document.

### One-to-Many

- Users have multiple phone numbers associated with them.
- Achieved by embedding an array of phone number documents within the user document.

### Many-to-Many

- Users can have multiple hobbies and skills, and each hobby/skill can be associated with multiple users.
